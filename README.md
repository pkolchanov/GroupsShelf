### Group View
Group View shows all glyphs of the kerning group. Add or remove glyphs to the selected group using − and + buttons. 

### Rename Groups palette
The palette for renaming all groups in the font. It's useful for removing or adding prefixes and suffixes, like `KO_` and `.1`. 
You could choose between substring or regular expression substitution.

### Fix Groups palette

- Remove groups without kerning paris literally deletes those groups. 
- Add missing composites will add composite glyphs if parent glyph is presented in the group. For example, if `A` in the group, `Á` will be added.
